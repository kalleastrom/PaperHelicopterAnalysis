# PaperHelicopterAnalysis

Code for the analysis of videos of paper helicopters. 
The purpuse is to automate the extraction of motion parameters, such as
rotational velocity from video.

The code was developed in a project in mathematical modelling at Lund University.

## Code

* Download/Clone/Fork the repository
** The project contains three folder
** data - put the video files here, don't sync the data to github
** tex - report
** matlab - the code for the analysis goes here
* Download data and put it in the data folder
* Start matlab and go to the matlab folder
* Run main.m

## Data

Example data for the system can be downloaded from
[http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/personal/kalle/PaperHelicopterData/data1.mov](http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/personal/kalle/PaperHelicopterData/data1.mov)

Briefly the datasets are:

1.  data1.mov - first testfilm, filmed from above, extract rotational velocity
